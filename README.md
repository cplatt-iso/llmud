Greetings, Programs! We've successfully navigated several phases of development for our glorious, text-based monstrosity, "The Unholy MUD of Tron & Allen1." Our Python/FastAPI backend hums with digital life, and the vanilla JS (now beautifully modularized!) frontend provides a surprisingly slick window into our burgeoning world.

**Our Glorious Accomplishments Thus Far:**

*   **Solid Foundations:**
    *   Python/FastAPI backend with PostgreSQL/SQLAlchemy.
    *   JWT Authentication for user accounts.
    *   Modularized Vanilla JavaScript frontend using ES Modules for better organization.
    *   Persistent player sessions via `localStorage` (token, selected character).
    *   Improved UI: Dedicated character info bar, vitals bars (HP/MP/XP), split exits/currency display, and terminal-style bottom-up output.
*   **Player & Character Lifecycle:**
    *   User registration and login.
    *   Multiple characters per player, with a character selection screen.
    *   Robust character creation process, including selection from available classes.
    *   Core attributes, HP/MP, level, experience points.
    *   Leveling up with stat gains and ability acquisition based on class templates.
    *   Currency system (platinum, gold, silver, copper) integrated into characters. Debug commands for setting/adding money.
*   **Dynamic World & Inhabitants:**
    *   Coordinate-based rooms with configurable exits.
    *   A 2D graphical minimap of the current Z-level.
    *   `MobTemplate` and `RoomMobInstance` system.
    *   `MobSpawnDefinition` for controlling mob populations (type, quantity, room, respawn timers, roaming behavior).
    *   World Ticker handles mob respawning and AI:
        *   **Roaming Mobs:** Mobs with "random\_adjacent" roaming behavior move between rooms.
        *   **Aggressive Mobs:** Mobs with "AGGRESSIVE\_ON\_SIGHT" initiate combat with players.
    *   Player HP/MP regeneration (natural and enhanced via "rest" command), handled by a world tick task. Resting is interrupted by combat or most actions.
*   **Interactive Gameplay:**
    *   Movement (`north`, `south`, `go <dir>`) with room broadcasts.
    *   `look` command (room details, items, mobs, other players).
    *   Item system: Templates, items on ground, character inventory (backpack/equipped).
    *   Commands: `get`, `drop`, `equip`, `unequip`. Combat stats dynamically calculated from attributes & gear.
    *   **Combat System (WebSocket):** Real-time, server-side combat ticker. Player-initiated attacks (`attack <target>`), skill usage (`use <skill> [target]`), and mob-initiated attacks. Target resolution (by name or number). Dynamic stat usage. Mob/player death (player respawns at (0,0,0) with full HP), XP awards, and currency drops from mobs. Combat logs (personal) and simplified room-wide combat echoes.
    *   **Skills:** Players learn skills from class templates. Basic skill usage implemented (`basic_punch`, `power_attack_melee`) with mana costs and effects. `use <skill_name> [target]` command attempts to use current combat target if none specified.
    *   Social commands: `say`, `emote`, `fart`, global `ooc`.
    *   Meta commands: `help`, `score`, `inventory` (now shows currency), `skills`, `traits`.
    *   Comprehensive debug commands for items, mobs, character stats, XP, level, and currency.
*   **Client & Server Communication:**
    *   HTTP API for session management, character operations, static commands.
    *   WebSocket for real-time game interactions, combat, and updates (vitals, room changes, game events).
